Welcome to OSTicket Reloaded
OsTicket Reloaded is an OsTicket which supports several localizations or languages. This fork is based on OsTicket fork from Carlos Delfino (admin@full.srv.br - http://www.full.srv.br) Version1.6 RC5 and now is based on new work on Version 1.6 ST. Building this  osTicket fork we are working on creating a multilingual osTicket that can be easily installed and used across the globe. So far we are supporting Spanish, English, Dutch, Portuguese and Brazilian.
