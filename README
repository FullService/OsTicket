Welcome to OSTicket Reloaded
============================

**OsTicket _Reloaded_** is an **OsTicket** which supports several localizations or languages. This _fork_ is based on **OsTicket** fork from Carlos Delfino (consultoria@carlosdelfino - http://carlosdelfino.eti.br) Version1.6 RC5 and now is based on new work on Version 1.6 ST. 

Building this  osTicket fork we are working on creating a multilingual osTicket that can be easily installed and used across the globe. So far we are supporting Spanish, English, Dutch, Portuguese and Brazilian Portuguese.
